# InventoryGui
A library that simplifies the creation of chest GUIs for Bukkit/Spigot plugins and 
allows assigning of the GUI to a specific InventoryHolder. If you are in need of a GUI for text inputs then take a look at [WesJD](https://github.com/WesJD)'s [AnvilGUI](https://github.com/WesJD/AnvilGUI) library.

Please note that this is **not a plugin!**

Requires Java 8.

## Using InventoryGui
Take a look at [the examples in the wiki](https://wiki.phoenix616.dev/library:inventorygui:usage) to learn how to create a GUI with this library or use the [InventoryGui Javadocs](https://docs.phoenix616.dev/inventorygui/).

## Maven information
You can easily depend on the library with maven.
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>minebench-repo</id>
        <url>https://repo.minebench.de/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>de.themoep</groupId>
        <artifactId>inventorygui</artifactId>
        <!--The following version may not be the latest. Check it before using.-->
        <version>1.4.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
As this is not a standalone plugin you have to shade it into your plugin!
E.g. with the maven-shade-plugin [like this](https://github.com/Minebench/Pipes/blob/048337e7594684353e7360411b1ef6ba8e7223c4/pom.xml#L63-L82).

You can also get development builds directly from the [Minebench Jenkins ci server](https://ci.minebench.de/job/InventoryGui/)
if you want to manually add it to your project but I strongly advise using a dependency management tool like maven or gradle!
